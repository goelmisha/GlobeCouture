🔧 Features:
“Guess the Era” game mode

Hover to reveal AI analysis

Scoring + unlockable facts

and on the globe site itself-

User selects a time period (e.g., 1970s, post-war, Y2K), and Perplexity describes:

A sample wardrobe of that era (e.g., disco outfits, grunge looks)

Materials, silhouettes, and accessories common at the time

What social movements or tech influenced those choices

🔧 Features:
Dropdown for decade + optional region (e.g., Paris 1920s vs. NYC 1920s)
